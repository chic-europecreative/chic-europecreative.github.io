## Fondations
This project is the result of a transnational cooperation associating different professional sectors as diverse as design and the arts trade; the digital sector and the culture of freedom; political engagement and local democracy; cultural mediation; and finally, economic, cultural and local development. 

Our partners from Belgium, Spain, France, Italy and Latvia are sensitive to the deep changes currently affecting our society, which is experiencing various crisis in terms of economy, democracy and identity…

They wanted to share their expertise in a collective project in order to experiment with new ways of « rebuilding cities », founded on an economy of solidarity.
